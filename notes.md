Design proportions and Relative Values:
* percentages(can't use for everything)
	* widths/heights
	* positioning sometimes
* Font size and padding and margin
	* percentage is not always the right way to go.
	* em/rem is the way to go!

# em = M

Default font-size: 24px

16px = 1em

2em = 32px
3em = 48px

_em's are relative to the closest parent that has a font size applied._
Grab source code example from minas git hub.

rem's make things a lot simpler!

# rems = root ems

_always relative to the font size set on your html element._

# VW and VH
vw - viewport width
vh - viewport height

* can use with a fair degree of confidence...




* you can set a default font size that the relative measurement em will relative to. Using media queries, when your default font size changes - everything else will change proportionally(as long as the sizes of the elemetns are defined using em).
